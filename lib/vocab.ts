export const VOCAB_GUIDE = `CATEGORY (the dish type) — one of:
${CATEGORIES.map((c) => `- ${c}`).join("\n")}
Notes: "Main or entree" includes sandwiches and breakfast. Salads, soups, and stews
have their own categories. "Core ingredient" = spice mixes, broths/stocks, pastes.

MAIN INGREDIENT (usually the protein) — one or more of:
${INGREDIENTS.map((i) => `- ${i}`).join("\n")}
Notes: "Poultry" = chicken, turkey, duck. "Pork" = bacon, pancetta, chorizo, ham,
veal. "Beef or lamb" = steak, lamb, bison. "Fish" = all seafood/shellfish.
"Pasta grain or bread" = rice, noodles, couscous, polenta, tortillas, dumplings,
pizza, gnocchi. "Fruit or vegetable" = any produce. "Sugar" = desserts where fruit
isn't the star. IMPORTANT: this column usually only records the PROTEIN, so a
chicken-and-pasta soup may be tagged only "Poultry". When a query names a food that
isn't a protein (e.g. eggplant, pasta, mushroom), also put that word in "keywords".

TRIED TAG (the user's personal verdict) — one of:
${TRIED_TAGS.map((t) => `- ${t}`).join("\n")}`;
